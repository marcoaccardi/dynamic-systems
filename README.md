## About
Dynamic Systems is an interdisciplinary project that explores the relationship between art and science through the interpretation of scientific data related to climate change. 

The data was collected from an expedition to Antarctica and simulations using the global sea ice-ocean model FESOM, which shed light on the current state of the polar regions and their changes over the past 30 years. They show how changes in polar regions affect the overall climate system and how they are connected to human activities.
